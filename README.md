# 💫 About Me:
👋 Hi, I'm Edllyn! I’m an Electrical Engineering graduate, and I’ve been working in IT since 2021, having worked in development, forensics, and data analysis.<br><br>🚀 Currently, I’m pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at USP, where I continue to explore new technologies and deepen my knowledge in the field. I love tackling challenges and finding creative solutions to complex problems.<br><br>💻 I’m always excited to apply what I've learned and contribute to open-source projects. If you also love bikes and a good coding challenge, let’s chat!<br><br>🔧 On my GitHub, you’ll find a mix of tech projects and a little bit of everything I’ve picked up along the way. Feel free to explore, contribute, and of course, learn alongside me!🚴‍♀️
